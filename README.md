# 🧠 Object Detection Web App using Streamlit and YOLO

In this project, I’ve built an **Object Detection Web App** powered by **Streamlit** and **YOLO**. 🚀  
This app integrates multiple **pretrained models** (like Apple, Banana, Orange, Bear, Brain Tumor, Number Plate, Pothole, and more) into one unified web interface using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Ultralytics YOLO**.

## 🎯 Features
- Upload any image for detection 🖼️  
- Choose from multiple pretrained models 🔍  
- Perform real-time object detection with a single click ⚡  
- View detection counts and visualized bounding boxes 🎯  
- Built with a clean and interactive **Streamlit** UI  

This project is ideal for anyone looking to:
- Learn how to **integrate YOLO with Streamlit**
- Understand **real-time inference and visualization**
- Build **multi-model detection dashboards** for various use cases
